<H1>A Quick Guide to writing JRMS applications</H1>

<H2>1. Introduction</H2>
JRMS stands for Java Reliable Multicast Service. It is a Java library for
building reliable multicast applications. In this quick guide, we provide
various tips to help you write an application using JRMS.  We first walk
through fragments from a real application to illustrate how to use some
of the key objects in the JRMS package.  JRMS has many auto-configuration
features for ease of use; however, at times, it is necessary or desirable
to resort to manual configuration.  This is explained in the following
section.  Finally, we also explain the <a href="#addingNewProtocol" >steps</a>
involved to add a new transport protocol into the JRMS framework.

<H2>2. Example application</H2>

<H3>2.1 Overview</H3>

This simple example application involves a sender transmitting data to
one or more receivers. To help conceptualize, we list the logical steps
the sender and receivers perform:

<BR><BR>

  </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>We refer to steps 1-4 as the <I>set-up phase</I>, and step 6 as the
<i>tear-down</i> phase. 

<P>There are considerable details and variations: for example, what is
in the transport profile? Is the data sent as a stream, or in logical blocks?
Is data sent continuously (file transfer) or with interleaving gaps (publish
and subscribe)? When does the sender stop advertising? We will try to cover
some of these below.

<H3>2.2 Classes used</H3>
Using the JRMS API means importing and instantiating the JRMS classes.
In the example application, some of the classes used are:
<PRE>
        import com.sun.multicast.allocation.MulticastAddressManager;

	import com.sun.multicast.reliable.channel.ChannelManagerFinder;
	import com.sun.multicast.reliable.channel.PrimaryChannelManager;
	import com.sun.multicast.reliable.channel.Channel;

	import com.sun.multicast.reliable.transport.TransportProfile;
	import com.sun.multicast.reliable.transport.tram.TRAMTransportProfile;
	import com.sun.multicast.reliable.transport.RMPacketSocket;

	import java.net.InetAddress;
	import java.net.DatagramPacket;
</PRE>
TRAM is used here as an example transport; JRMS supports multiple transports.
Documentation on the com.sun.multicast classes can be found from the JRMS javadoc pages.

<H3>2.4 Creating a transport profile</H3>
The <I>transport profile </I>is a very important channel parameter. The
transport profile dictates which transport is used for multicast, and contains
various transport parameters, such as multicast address, maximum data rate and
if data delivery is ordered. The following code fragment illustrates step (S1):
<PRE>
	private TransportProfile tp;
	private InetAddress addr;
	private int port;
        private Scope scope;
	
	// first, allocate one multicast address


        MulticastAddressManager mam = MulticastAddressManager.getMulticastAddressManager();
        if (scope == null) {
            scope = mam.getScopeList(IPv4AddressType.getAddressType()).findScopeForTTL(ttl);
            if (scope == null)
		throw new IOException("No scope for requested TTL");
        }

        /* get an address with a long duration */
        Lease lease = mam.allocateAddresses(null, scope, (int) ttl,
                    1, startTime, startTime, duration, -1, null);
        InetAddress addr = ((IPv4Address) lease.getAddresses().
                    getFirstAddress()).toInetAddress();

        // create a TRAM transport profile
	// other transports, such as UM, LRMP, can be used instead of TRAM	
	tp = new TRAMTransportProfile(addr,port);

	// set multicast session scope	
	tp.setTTL(ttl);

	// enable ordered delivery
	tp.setOrdered(true);

        // set maximum rate of data transfer
	tp.setMaximumSpeed(speed);

	// and set any other transport-specific parameters
	...

</PRE>

<a name="s23"></a>
<H3>2.5 Creating a channel</H3>
The channel is created by first finding a primary
channel manager and then using it to create a channel:
<PRE>
	// create a channel
	private PrimaryChannelManager pcm;
	private Channel channel;
	pcm = ChannelManagerFinder.getPrimaryChannelManager(null);
	channel = pcm.createChannel();
	channel.setChannelName(channelName);
	channel.setApplicationName(applicationName);
	channel.setTransportProfile(tp);
	channel.setAbstract(someBlurbAboutThisChannel);
	channel.setAdvertisingRequested(true);

	// plus any other channel parameters
	...

	// once enabled, configuration is complete and advertisement can start
	channel.setEnabled(true);
</PRE>
Note, the parameter passed to <tt>getPrimaryChannelManager</tt> is a reference to
the primary channel manager.  When null is specified, the local channel
manager is returned.

These code fragments illustrate steps (S2) and (S3). Note the lines
<tt>setTransportProfile</tt> and <tt>setAdvertisingRequested</tt>;
the former provides the transport mechanism, and the latter gets the channel
advertised so that receivers can find out about it.

<a name="r123"></a>
<H3>2.6 Receiver's set-up phase</H3>
At a receiver, the application uses the static <tt>ChannelManagerFinder</tt>
to get a primary channel manager, which is then used to check advertised
channels. The application then selects the ones it is interested in:
<PRE>
	// find the channel of interest
	private PrimaryChannelManager pcm;
	private Channel channel;
	pcm = ChannelManagerFinder.getPrimaryChannelManager(null);
	
	// channel lookup is by channelName and applicationName
	// since more than one may match, need to determine the right one
	long channelids[] = pcm.getChannelList(channelName, applicationName);
	
	// loop through the following to find the channel of interest
	channel = pcm.getChannel(channelids[i]);

	// apply application-specific criteria
	checkInterest(channel);
	...
</PRE>

In order to receive data, the application needs the transport profile:
<PRE>
	// extract the transport profile from the advertised channel
	tp = channel.getTransportProfile();
</PRE>
The transport profile that was originally created by the sender has been
made part of the channel which through advertisement became known to the
local channel manager.  This explains how the receiver gets hold of the
sender's transport profile.

The above code fragments illustrated the receiver's set-up phase,
steps (R1)-(R3).

<a name="s456"></a>
<H3>2.7 Socket and data</H3>
In order to send and receive data, the sender and receiver
both create sockets using the transport profile. This is what the sender does:
<PRE>
	private RMPacketSocket ms;
	private DatagramPacket sendPacket;
	byte[]	senddata = new byte[PACKET_SIZE];
	
	// create socket
	ms = channel.createRMPacketSocket(tp, TransportProfile.SENDER);
	// or directly using tp
	// ms = tp.createRMPacketSocket(TransportProfile.SENDER);

	// data transmission
	// repeat the following according to application needs
	preparePacket(senddata);
	sendPacket = new DatagramPacket(senddata, senddata.length);
	ms.send(sendPacket);
	...

	// teardown phase
	ms.close();

	// stop advertising this channel
	// this can be done earlier, e.g. after data transmission starts
	channel.setAdvertisingRequested(false);
</PRE>
Note there are a couple of ways to create a socket, either using the channel's
<tt>createRMPacketSocket</tt> method, or using the transport profile's
<tt>createRMPacketSocket</tt> method. 
Usually, the sockets are created using channel methods.  Channels provide 
more services to applications, such as security and filtering mechanisms.
A very simple application that does not need channel features can use methods
of the transport profile to create sockets.

<a name="r456"></a>This is what the receiver does:
<PRE>
	private RMPacketSocket ms;
	private DatagramPacket recvPacket;

	// create socket
	ms = channel.createRMPacketSocket(tp, TransportProfile.RECEIVER);

	// data reception
	// loop through the following until end of transmission recognized
	try {
		recvPacket = ms.receive();
		// application-specific processing
		consumePacket(recvPacket);
	} catch ( SessionDoneException e ) {
		// teardown phase
		ms.close();
	} catch ( JRMSException e) {
		System.out.println("...");
	}
</PRE>
Note, the use of exceptions to dispatch different return conditions is
a very basic Java feature.  For the sake of simplicity, we have not used
exceptions in the example code fragments, except in the above case where
we have illustrated the use of a couple of them.
The JRMS API contains a set of common exceptions supported by its
implementations.

<H3>2.8 Stream socket interface</H3>
It is also possible to use a stream socket interface. In that case, the
sending and receiving are in terms of reading and writing to a stream interface.
At the sender side:
<PRE>
	// create stream socket
	ms = channel.createRMStreamSocket(tp, TransportProfile.SENDER);
	// or directly
	// ms = tp.createMRStreamSocket(TransportProfile.SENDER);
	OutputStream s = ms.getOutputStream();

	// data transmission
	// use whatever stream write method that's convenient, e.g.
	s.write("hello");
	...
	// send
	s.flush();

	// teardown phase
	ms.close();
	channel.setAdvertisingRequested(false);
</PRE>
Equivalently, at the receiver:
<PRE>
	// create stream socket at receiver
	ms = channel.createRMStreamSocket(tp, TransportProfile.RECEIVER);
	// or directly
	// ms = tp.createMRStreamSocket(TransportProfile.RECEIVER);
	InputStream s = ms.getInputStream();

	// data reception
	// use whatever read method that's convenient
	byte message[] = new byte[SIZE];
	int len = s.read(message);
	...

	// teardown phase
	ms.close();
</PRE>
<br><br>

<a name="configurations"></a>
<H2>3. Operational Tips</H2>
JRMS provides many auto-configuration features.  For example, information
about a multicast session (channel) is broadcasted using SAP (Session
Announcement Protocol).  This means little or no configuration needs to be
done to the receivers before the multicast session can begin.  When using
the TRAM protocol, the receivers automatically organize themselves into
a repair tree to provide reliability service.

<p>This section explains various manual configuration tips when it
is desirable/necessary to override autoconfiguration.

<H3>3.1 Storing channel parameters in a file</H3>

The SAP message size has some limits, when exceeded they would not traverse
beyond the local network.  Sometimes, network managers do not want to
allow SAP in their networks.  In such situations, the channel can be
created and stored in a file.  Note, this is much easier than storing the
channel parameters one by one into a file.  The receiver application fetches
the file somehow (e.g. via the web, or file sharing) and restores the
channel object.

The methods to file and read a channel are implemented as part of the
LocalPCM object (which implements the PrimaryChannelManager interface).
The created channel must be cast into a LocalChannel.  LocalChannel is
a serializable implementation of Channel (some strictly local parameters
of LocalChannel are declared transient to make it serializable).

The following code fragment illustrate how to store a channel in a file:

<PRE>
	// Get a LocalPCM
	LocalPCM m = 
          (LocalPCM) ChannelManagerFinder.getPrimaryChannelManager(null);
          
        // Create a serializable channel (LocalChannel) and fill in the
        // parameters, including the transport profile
	LocalChannel c = (LocalChannel) m.createChannel();
	c.setChannelName(channelName);
	c.setApplicationName(applicationName); 
	InetAddress mcastAddress = InetAddress.getByName(address);
	tp = new TRAMTransportProfile(mcastAddress, port);
	tp.setMaxDataRate(speed);
	tp.setTTL(ttl);
	tp.setOrdered(true);    
	c.setTransportProfile(tp);
	c.setEnabled(true);
	
	// Use the LocalPCM fileChannel method to store the channel in
	// a file.  Here, the ChannelName is used as the file name.
	m.fileChannel(c, channelName);
</PRE>

And this is how you read it back:

<PRE>
	LocalPCM m =
	  (LocalPCM) ChannelManagerFinder.getChannelManager(null);
	LocalChannel c = (LocalChannel) cm.readChannel(channelFileName);
        TransportProfile tp = c.getTransportProfile();
</PRE>

For many situations, it is convenient to create a channel once and use
it again and again.  For example, your application distributes daily news
continuously.  The sender and receivers can be restarted at different times
and it is not convenient to use SAP.  Then a channel can be created and
posted on a web page (or a well-known directory if file sharing is
available).  Both the sender and receivers read the channel from the same
place.  The side-effect, in this case, is that the different sessions will
have the same session Id.

<p>In the <b>simple</b> package, there is a SimpleChannel program that lets
you create a simple channel with a few of the essential parameters that
you can enter on the command line.

<H3>3.2 Static repair tree configuration</H3>

There is some limited capability for configurating the repair tree.
If you follow the steps below, you can control which repair head a
particular receiver uses.

<ol>
  <li> When you prepare the transport profile, add the following step:
  <pre>
  tp.setTreeFormationPreference(TRAMTRansportProfile.TREE_FORM_HAMTHA_STATIC_R) </pre>
  This tells all the receivers that the session is using HAMTHA method for
  for tree formation, and reading a static file is allowed.  (HAMTHA stands
  for "Head Advertisement before data starts and Member Triggered Head
  Advertisement after data started", which is the default method).
  <p>
  <li> For each receiver that needs to have a specific repair head, create
  a file, named jrmstree.cfg (in the application's directory), that
  contains the following line:
  <pre>
  [head's ip address] [ttl from head]   </pre>
  The ip address is in the a.b.c.d form, and the ttl is the number of hops
  (in terms of multicast) the receiver is away from the head (e.g. equal to
  1 if both hosts are on the same LAN).  If you allow a number of possible
  repair heads, you can include a number of lines in the file.
  <p>
  <li> For each receiver that must serve as a head, create a file, named
  jrmstree.cfg (in the application's directory), that contains the
  following line:
  <pre>
  [local host's ip address] 0  </pre>
  If this receiver must have a specific parent, then it must contain an
  additional line as described above.
</ol>

This is often found useful when setting up a long-term service, or during
testing.

<a name="addingNewProtocol"></a>
<H2>4. Importing new transport protocols into JRMS</H2>

The following describes the procedure to add a new transport protocol 
into the JRMS environment.
<OL>
<LI> Select a package name for the transport protocol to be added.
     For example:
     <pre>  <code>     com.mycompany.newprotocolName </code> </pre>

<LI> Implement a transport profile class for the new transport. Note
     that the transport profile class implements the interface
     specified in TransportProfile.java.
     
<LI> Depending on the protocol, implement any one or both of the 
     following interfaces.
     <UL>
	      <LI> RMPacketSocket.java
	      <LI> RMStreamSocket.java
     </UL>
 
<LI> Implement an RMStatistics interface (optional).

<LI> Compile the package. Applications will have to import the
     new transport package to use it.

</OL><BR>
<B>Transport Profile Variable Names</B><BR>
Here is a suggestion about variable names in the transport
profile class.  This class defines a set of parameters used by your
transport, for example:
<pre>
	Transport name and version
	Multicast Address
	Multicast Port
	Ordered Delivery Available
	MultiSender Support Available
	AuthenticationSecurity Specifications
	Maximum Data Rate
</pre>
While the names of these parameters may be long externally, it is
helpful to use shortened variable names internally.  The reason is that
these names get carried in the serialized form of the transport profile
sent in channel advertisements.  Using shorter variable names helps avoid 
exceeding the packet size limit imposed by the advertising protocol.  
The following is an example definition:
<pre>
	private int mr = DEFAULT_MAX_RATE;
	public int getMaximumDataRate() { return mr; }
	public void setMaximumDataRate(int rate) { mr = rate; }	
</pre>
