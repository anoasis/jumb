Provides services for advertising multicast sessions.
<BR>
<P>
This package consists of Advertisements, Advertisers, and Listeners.
Advertisements contain information about multicast sessions.  The current Advertisement
class implementation is based on the Session Description Protocol.  Advertisements are announced
by the Advertiser class.  Advertisements are collected using the Listener class.  Both
of these implementations are based on the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP).  However, the
classes provide for some customization, particularly in the multicast address used for the
advertisements.  By default, the standard SAP address of 224.2.127.254
is used, but this can be overridden.
