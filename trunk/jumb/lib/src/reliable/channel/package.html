Controls session-level aspects of a reliable multicast application.

Three interfaces and one class make up the core of the Channel Management API.</P>

<P>The <FONT FACE="Courier New">Channel</FONT> interface defines methods that are supported by 
all channels. Many accessor methods are provided to get and set properties of the channel such as 
the channel name and the data start time. Other methods establish communications on the channel 
or destroy, duplicate, or otherwise operate on the channel.</P>
Currently the only implementation of the Channel class is LocalChannel.

<P>The <FONT FACE="Courier New">ChannelManager</FONT> interface defines methods that are supported 
by all channel managers. These methods allow the caller to find channels based on such criteria
as a channel name.</P>

<P>The <FONT FACE="Courier New">PrimaryChannelManager</FONT> interface extends the 
<FONT FACE="Courier New">ChannelManager</FONT> interface, adding methods that are supported only 
by PCMs. These methods allow the caller to create new channels.</P>
Currently the only implementation of the PrimaryChannelManager class is LocalPCM.

<P>The <FONT FACE="Courier New">ChannelManagerFinder</FONT> class is used to find Channel
Managers. The <FONT FACE="Courier New">getChannelManager</FONT> method finds a channel manager 
with the specified principal name. The get<FONT FACE="Courier New">PrimaryChannelManager</FONT> 
method does the same for primary channel managers. Both methods take a principal name as their 
sole argument, with null indicating that the local PCM should be used.</P>

Channels provide a mechanism for applications to deliver data to 
multiple receivers via IP multicast.  Receivers obtain this data by subscribing 
to selected channels.  Each channel may be transmitted over a single multicast 
address, or multiple channels may share a single multicast address.  Channels
may contain unencrypted data and be made available to any receiver able to listen 
on a multicast address, or channels may carry only encrypted data and require 
registration with a channel manager for authentication and key distribution.  
Applications using channels can access both channel management and 
data transmission facilities through the Channel Management API (CMAPI). </P>

Channels are mechanisms for transferring data from senders 
to groups of receivers over IP multicast.   Channel objects reside on 
primary channel managers.  They are also accessible from senders, receivers, 
and channel managers. Channels are created on primary channel managers at the request 
of senders.  The primary channel manager assigns a unique channel ID to each channel.  
Channel information is propagated through the network by multicast advertisement, or 
via unicast communication with channel managers.</P>

<P>Channels contain all parameters needed for channel operation.  A channel's 
application name specifies the application to which it belongs.  In this context, 
the application name does not indicate an executable program; it is simply a text
string that may be displayed by a receiver, or used to search for certain channels. 
A channel's channel name describes its content to the receiver. Different channels 
with a particular application name may share the same channel name and differ by 
some other characteristic, such as speed.</P>

<P>The channel also specifies the transport profile to be used, including the multicast 
address and port number.  Several channels can share the same multicast address.</P>

<P>Each channel specifies how receivers may learn about the channel.  Channels may be 
advertised using the advertising package.  In this case, receivers use a local PCM object 
to listen for advertisements.  Or, for added security, receivers may be required to 
register with a channel manager in order to learn about channels. </P>

Senders use channels to distribute data to a set of receivers.  In order 
to create a channel, a sender contacts or locally constructs a primary channel manager.  
Multiple senders are allowed per channel.  Channels may then be advertised by the PCM.  
Once data transmission is complete, senders may choose to destroy the channel, or keep it 
available for future transmissions.</P>

<P>Senders continue to control the channel throughout the data transmission.  Various 
channel parameters, including advertisement and encryption characteristics may be changed 
without closing the channel. </P>

Channel managers are responsible for all aspects of maintaining channels.  For a given 
channel, one channel manager called the primary channel manager (PCM), processes 
requests to create, manage, and destroy the channel.  PCMs also advertise channels and cache 
received advertisements.  All channel managers may listen to advertisements and cache the 
information.  Receivers may then access the cached information instead of listening to 
advertisements themselves.  Channel managers provide methods for senders and receivers to 
register for various events.</P>

Receivers are the destination end-stations for a channel's multicast data.   Receivers 
select channels to which to subscribe in one of three ways: </P>
<UL>
<LI>from advertisements multicast by the primary channel manager and fielded by its local 
primary channel manager</LI>
<LI>by communicating with a known channel manager</LI>
<LI>from information built into the receiver application.  </LI></UL>

<P>Receivers may be required to register with a channel manager to be authenticated and obtain 
additional channel information.  </P>
