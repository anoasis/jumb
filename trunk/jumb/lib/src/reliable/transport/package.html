Provides a set of interfaces for accessing and implementing reliable multicast transports.
<BR>
<P>The transport system is responsible for providing a reliable multicast transport. It may be 
used directly by the application or indirectly through the channel management system.  The
transport system is composed of two parts, a set of protocol-independent transport APIs and 
one or more transport protocols.

<P>Many different reliable multicast transport protocols have been developed and many more are on 
the way. Therefore, this package defines a Multicast Transport Application Programmer Interface (MTAPI) 
that channel managers, senders, and receivers may use to configure transport protocols and send 
and receive data using them.

<P>This package includes implementations of two existing reliable multicast transport protocols,
TRAM and LRMP.  It also includes
a set of APIs that allows new protocols to be plugged in and used by existing  
applications with little or no change to the applications.  New protocols must implement the
TransportProfile interface, and at least one of the two socket interfaces, RMPacketSocket and/or 
RMStreamSocket.

<P>The Tree-Based Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol (TRAM) is a reliable multicast protocol 
designed to support bulk data 
transfer with a single sender and multiple receivers. TRAM uses dynamic trees to implement local 
error recovery to scale to a very large number of receivers without imposing a serious burden on 
the sender. It also includes congestion control and other techniques necessary to operate efficiently 
and fairly with other protocols across the wide variety of link and client characteristics that make 
up the Internet.
