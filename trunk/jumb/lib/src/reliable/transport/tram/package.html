<h1>An implementation of the Tree-Based Reliable Multicast (TRAM) protocol.</h1>
<BR>
<P>The Tree-Based Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol (TRAM) is a reliable multicast 
protocol designed to support bulk data 
transfer with a single sender and multiple receivers. TRAM uses dynamic trees to implement local 
error recovery to scale to a very large number of receivers without imposing a serious burden on 
the sender. It also includes congestion control and other techniques necessary to operate efficiently 
and fairly with other protocols across the wide variety of link and client characteristics that make 
up the Internet.

A simulator interface is provided to enable TRAM to plug into network simulators for test purposes.

This TRAM implementation provides extensive <a href=#TRAM_Logging> logging support</a>.

<hr>
 TRAM supports extensive logging for debugging purposes. A class enabling dynamic
 control of logging on a running TRAM node is included in the TRAM 
 package. 
<p>
 The <b>ChangeTRAMLoggingOption</b> class dynamically enables logging in 
 TRAM nodes by sending a multicast control packet. The multicast control 
 packet is sent to the same multicast address and port pair on which the 
 TRAM session is currently active. The class supports the following options:
  <UL>
   <li> change logging options on every node tuned to the session, or 
        only on selected nodes
   <li> specify various combinations of logging functions and levels
   <LI> control the time-to-live (TTL) of the control message.
   </UL>
 <p>
 The different levels of logging supported can 
 be viewed by <a href="#LOGGING_LEVELS"> clicking here</a>.
<p> 
 Changing the TRAM logging option is a two step operation. The first step 
 involves creating the configuration file. Here the details of the multicast 
 session, TTL, target nodes, and logging functions and levels are specified in a 
 configuration file.
 The second step is to run the class.
 <br> <p>

 The <b>ChangeTRAMLoggingOption</b> class can be invoked from the command 
 line by issuing the following command. 
<p>
 <code><b> % java com.sun.multicast.reliable.transport.tram.ChangeTRAMLoggingOption   configFileName  </b> </code>
<p>
 The argument <b><I>configFileName</I></b> is the name of the file that 
 contains the details of the logging option message that is to be sent. A
 sample file is described <a href="#CONFIG_FILE"> here  </a>.

<a name=LOGGING_LEVELS><H2> Different functions and levels of logging supported in TRAM</H2>

 TRAM logging supports two categories of logging. The first  is the 
 <b>Level category</b> and the other is the <b>Function category</b>. The
 Level category is applicable to all the modules within TRAM. The Function
 category is applicable to the specific modules within TRAM. Fatal error 
 conditions (not listed below) cannot be masked and are always enabled. The 
 different levels in each of the above two categories are listed  below.
 <OL>
 <LI> <b>Level Category </b> <br>
    <UL>
    <LI> <b>LOG_NONE </b>  <br>
         This option causes logging to be turned off except for fatal errors.
	 <br>
    <LI> <b>LOG_VERBOSE </b><br>
         Choosing this option will result in logging every possible message in TRAM.
         This option is usually only used during TRAM development.   
        <br>

    <LI> <b>LOG_DIAGNOSTICS </b>
         Choosing this option will result in logging important events in 
         the code path, important usual and unusual events as well as non-fatal
         error events. 
         <br>

    <LI> <b>LOG_INFO </b>
         This logging option is informational. Choosing this option 
         will result in logging the very important milestones and events. 
         This is generally the recommended mode.
         <br>
    </UL>
    <br>
 <LI> <b> Function Category</b> <br>
     <UL>
     <LI> <b> LOG_CONGESTION </b>
           Choosing this option will result in logging all events related to
           TRAM congestion control. 
       <br>

     <LI> <b> LOG_CONTROL_MESSAGES </b>
           Choosing this option will result in logging TRAM control message
           events.
     <br>

     <LI> <b> LOG_DATA_MESSAGES </b>
           Choosing this option will result in logging TRAM data message
           events.
      <br>

     <LI> <b> LOG_SESSION </b>
          Choosing this option will result in logging TRAM messages that
          session related.
      <br>

     <LI> <b> LOG_SECURITY </b>
           Choosing this option will result in logging TRAM messages that are
           related to security. 
        <br>
     <LI> <b> LOG_DATACACHE </b>
          Choosing this option will result in logging TRAM messages that
          are related to the TRAM data cache.
     <br><br>
Note that enabling logging for a specific function results in the equivalent of verbose logging 
for that function.

# This file is a template to list the various options that are
# available to dynamically enable TRAM logging.
# The basic syntax is
#
#    Option keyword = required Value
#
# The following are the two ways by which multiple values on the right
# hand can be specified. Currently only MEMBER_ADDRESS and LOG_OPTION
# are the only options that support specification of multiple right
# hand side values. The two ways of listing multiple right hand side
# values are described below:
# 
#   1. Multiple member addresses are ',' separated as shown below.
#      White spaces are ignored.
#
#          129.148.75.98 , 129.148.75.97,129.148.75.96
#
#   2. Choosing multiple logging options are '|' (OR'd) as shown below.
#      White spaces are ignored.
#
#	 LOG_SECURITY |LOG_CONGESTION| LOG_DATA_MESSAGES
#
# The following is the list of various <b><I>Option Keywords</b></I> that 
# are currently recognized:
#
#        MULTICAST_ADDRESS     : Multicast address of the session.
#
#	 SOURCE_ADDRESS	       : Address of the node sending multicast 
#                                session data

#                                being sent.
#
# 	 TTL                   : The TTL scope to which the message should be 
#                                sent. default 1
#
#	 LOG_OPTION            : Required logging option. Look below for option
#                                definitions. The default option (if not listed)
#                                is LOG_NONE.
#
#	 MEMBER_ADDRESS        : List of node's addresses that need to turn on

#  will result in the use of the DEFAULT values.
#  DEFAULT Values are
#
#    TTL = 1

#  The use of '#' at the beginning of a line indicates a comment line.
MULTICAST_ADDRESS = 224.10.10.20
