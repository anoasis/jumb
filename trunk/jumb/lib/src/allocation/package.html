Provides multicast address allocation services.
<BR>
<P>
<P>The address allocation system is responsible for managing multicast address allocation. 

<P>One of the first steps in establishing a multicast session is choosing a multicast address. Because 
multicast addresses are shared across multiple networks, this is a tricky problem. Several techniques 
are in use today, but none are ideal. The address allocation system provides a standard API (MAMAPI) 
that may be used to allocate and deallocate addresses. Different address allocators may be plugged 
in to implement different allocation techniques.
