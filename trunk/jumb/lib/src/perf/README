The scripts in this directory (<workspace>/perf) start the Stock Sender/Viewer 
and data Sender/Receiver programs.

They can be run directly from this directory or from the bcn web site.
If run from the web site, the necessary classes and scripts are automatically
copied to the user's local machine in /tmp/jrms.$USER and the scripts
are run from there to avoid overloading bcn.east.

To run directly from here without copying files, you must set the
environment variable jrms_target_tree as described below.

Then run StockViewer.sh.

Stop here unless you want details.

============================================================================

To run the senders (StockSender.sh and DataSender.sh) you must set
the environment variable "jrms_target_tree" to the directory just
above your workspace directory. For example, if your workspace is 

    /home/jrms/version1.0/src

then

    setenv jrms_target_tree /home/jrms/version1.0.

You must also set the multicast addresses you want to use for sending.

"stocksender_multicast_address" is for the StockSender.  For example,

    setenv stocksender_multicast_address 224.148.74.41.

"data_sender_multicast_address" is for the DataSender.  For example,

    setenv data_sender_multicast_address 224.148.74.49.

Log files are placed in under this directory in StockLog and DataXferLog.

CurrentStockLog and CurrentDataXferLog are links to the current log files
in the StockLog and DataXferLog directories.  These links are 
set to the current directory by the sender scripts.

To run receivers directly in this directory and have both the sender 
and receiver log files placed in the same directory, you must set 
the variable "jrms_target_tree" as decribed above.

If you don't set jrms_target_tree, it is automatically set to /tmp/jrms and 
the scripts and necessary class files are copied from 

    /net/bcn.east/files2/projects/jrms/version1.0

to your local machine in 

    /tmp/jrms.$USER.

The directory structure there is similar to where you are now:

    /tmp/jrms.$USER/
	Kit/classes.jar
	src/perf/
	   CurrentDataXferLog
	   CurrentStockLog
	   DataReceiver.sh
	   DataXferLog
	   Environment.sh
	   StockLog
	   StockViewer.sh

Then the scripts are run from /tmp/jrms.$USER/src/perf and receiver log 
files are placed under there.  The actual receiver directory names 
containing the log files match the directory names for the Senders'
log files so that you can match up senders and receivers even though 
the logs are on different machines.

You won't need arguments to any of the scripts unless you want
to override defaults such as port numbers, log levels, multicast address,
etc.

To start the Stock Sender:
    StockSender.sh [<StockServer arguments, see ArgParser.java>]

    In addition to setting the variable jrms_target_tree, you'll need to set
    stocksender_multicast_address to the multicast address that
    your want the sender to use.

To start the Data Sender:
    DataSender.sh [<DataSender arguments, see ArgParser.java>]

    In addition to setting the variable jrms_target_tree, you'll need to set
    datasender_multicast_address to the multicast address that
    your want the sender to use.

To start receivers:

    StockViewer.sh [<Stock Viewer arguments, see ArgParser.java>]

    The StockViewer.sh script starts the stock viewer and in addition
    starts a DataReceiver in the background.  When StockViewer.sh exits
    it creates a file called /tmp/KillDataReceiver.  This tells the
    DataReceiver to exit.

    A quick way to kill the StockViewer is to create the file
    /tmp/KillStockViewer.

    StockViewer.sh checks if DataReceiver.sh is already running.  
    If not, it starts it.  Then it start the StockViewer, and waits for 
    exit status.  If the StockSender stops sending, then StockViewer.sh
    restarts the StockViewer automatically.
    
    DataReceiver.sh [<data receiver arguments, see ArgParser.java>]
    Starts a data receiver.  You can run this manually if you're 
    just testing data transfers.

    When running from /tmp/jrms.$USER, StockViewer.sh and DataReceiver.sh 
    send email to the alias StockViewerEmail@proteus.East.Sun.COM and 
    DataReceiverEmail@proteus.East.Sun.COM respectively.  The email message
    tells whether the receiver is starting or stopping, the hostname, and the
    user name.  This information can be used to find the log files for
    a particular member.  When the StockViewer or DataReceiver exits,
    the complete log is emailed with a message indicating that the viewer
    or receiver has exited.

    When the sender is stopped, the email file containing all the receiver's
    emails is moved to the sender's log directory.


Other files in this directory
-----------------------------
Environment.sh contains commands to set variables
    common for all the scripts.  For example, jrms_classes is set in here.

stockview.html is the html file used by the bcn web site.
    XXX mention other files related to web site.

DataSender.arguments   
    This file contains the actual arguments used by the Data Sender.
    The Data Receiver reads this file and uses arguments common to
    the sender and receiver.

StockSender.arguments
    This file contains the actual arguments used by the Stock Sender.
    The Stock Receiver reads this file and uses arguments common to
    the sender and receiver.

CurrentStockLog/
    This is a link to the directory where the Stock Sender (and Receiver
    programs) are currently logging data.  The link points into
    StockLog/<date>.<time>.  This link is changed to point to a new
    directory when the StockSender exits.

CurrentDataXferLog/
    This is a link to the directory where the Data Sender (and Receiver
    programs) are currently logging data.  The link points into
    DataXferLog/<date>.<time>.  This link is changed to point to a new
    directory when the DataSender exits.

./DataXfer   			log files for the Data Sender and Receivers
    <date>.<time>
	DataSender.<host>.<time>	
	<host>.<time>
    <date>.<time>
	DataSender.<host>.<time>	
	<host>.<time>
    ...

./Stock				log files for the Stock Sender and Receivers
    <date>.<time>
	StockSender.<host>.<time>
	<host>.<time>
    <date>.<time>
	StockSender.<host>.<time>
	<host>.<time>
    ...

The source files for the applications are in <workspace>/reliable/sample_code/stock

The files are:

	ArgParser.java        Parse command line arguments.
	DataSender.java       Send a specified amount of known data.
	DataReceiver.java     Receive data and verify its correctness.
        DataStats.java	      Display statistics for data transfers.
	StockServer.java      Send a quote for SUNW on SUNWStockChannel.
	StockViewer.java      Find SUNWStockChannel and display quote for SUNW.
	StockDebugFlags.java  debug flags

The command line arguments are documented in ArgParser.java.
Explicit command line arguments specified when invoking a script override 
the defaults in the scripts.

Example of deployment for testing Data Transfers and pruning.
-------------------------------------------------------------
On a server such as bcn:

	cd /home/jrms/version1.0/src/perf
        setenv jrms_target_tree /home/jrms/version1.0
	setenv stocksender_multicast_address 224.148.74.41
	StockSender.sh & 
	sleep 3 
        setenv data_sender_multicast_address 224.148.74.49
	DataSender.sh &

On each machine to receive the information:

	cd /home/jrms/version1.0/src/perf
	StockViewer.sh

That's it.  Log files should tell it all.

A better way to get receivers to run the StockViewer is through
the bcn web site http://bcn.east/projects/jrms/index.html.  
Click on StockViewer near the bottom.

If changes are made to the Data Sender/Receiver which you want to try,
just kill and restart DataSender.sh.  You'll get a new log directory,
and all the receivers should exit and restart logging to the new directory.

If changes are made to the Stock Sender/Viewer which you want to try,
just kill and restart StockSender.sh.  You'll get a new log directory,
and all the viewers should exit and restart logging to the new directory.


Notes on how it works off the tangled web...
--------------------------------------------
stockview.html has a reference in it to 

    /cgi-bin/pgm-exec.cgi?/net/bcn.east/files2/projects/jrms/version1.0/src/perf/StockViewer.sh

On bcn, do ps -ef | grep httpd to find out the location of the file httpd.conf.
Look for ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/opt/apache/cgi-bin/"

We now have the location of cgi-bin.

pgm-exec.cgi is in /opt/apache/cgi-bin.
Its job is to produce an html file to stdout:

    echo "Content-type: application/x-csh-swan"

Netscape must be configured with:

    application/x-csh-swan  xpreview %s

xpreview is a script in /usr/dist/pkgs/xmessage/5bin.sun4
which puts up a dialog box asking if you run to run the program
and then starts a c shell and gives StockViewer.sh as the file.
