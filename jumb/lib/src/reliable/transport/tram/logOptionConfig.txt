# This file is a template to list the various options that are
# available to dynamically enable TRAM logging.
# The basic syntax is
#    <Option keyword> = <required Value>
#
# The following are the two ways by which multiple values on the right
# hand can be specified. Currently only MEMBER_ADDRESS and LOG_OPTION
# are the only options that support specification of multiple right
# hand side values. The two ways of listing multiple right hand side
# values are described below:
# 
#   1. Multiple member addresses are ',' separated as shown below.
#      White spaces are ignored.
#
#          129.148.75.98 , 129.148.75.97,129.148.75.96
#
#   2. Choosing multiple logging options are '|' (OR'd) as shown below.
#      White spaces are ignored.
#
#	 LOG_SECURITY |LOG_CONG| LOG_DATAMESG
#
# The following is the list of various <Option Keywords> that are currently
# recognized:
#
#        MULTICAST_ADDRESS     : Multicast address of the session.
#
#	 SOURCE_ADDRESS	       : Address of the node sending multicast 
#                                session data 
#                 
# 	 SESSION_ID            : Session id of the multicast session	
#
# 	 PORT                  : Port number on which the multicast data is 
#                                being sent.
#
# 	 TTL                   : The TTL scope to which the message should be 
#                                sent. default 1
#
#	 LOG_OPTION            : Required logging option. Look below for 
#                                option definitions. Default option(if not 
#                                Listed) LOG_NONE.
#
#	 MEMBER_ADDRESS        : List of node's addresses that need to adopt 
#                                the logging option. If no address is listed, 
#                                All members of the session will adopt this 
#                                option.
#
#
# The following lists the various LOG_OPTIONs currently supported.
#
#                                   LOG_CONGESTION
#                                   LOG_CONTROL_MESSAGES
#                                   LOG_DATA_MESSAGES 
#                                   LOG_SESSION
#                                   LOG_SECURITY
#                                   LOG_DATACACHE
#                                   LOG_DIAGNOSTICS
#                                   LOG_VERBOSE
#                                   LOG_INFO
#                                   LOG_NONE
#                                   LOG_ALL
#
#
#
#  The following is a sample configuration. Any option keyword not listed
#  will result in the use of the DEFAULT values.
#  DEFAULT Values are
#    TTL = 1, PORT = 4567
#  The use of '#' at the begining of a line indicates a comment line.
MULTICAST_ADDRESS = 224.10.10.20
PORT = 4567
TTL = 10
LOG_OPTION = LOG_CONGESTION | LOG_CONTROL_MESSAGES 
MEMBER_ADDRESS = 129.148.75.95,129.148.75.107, 129.148.75.125
