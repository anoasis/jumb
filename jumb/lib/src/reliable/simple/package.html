Provides streamlined classes for building reliable
multicast applications.
<BR>
The simple classes are useful for building prototypes or simple applications that use
the default features of the channel and transport packages.  The two classes (SimpleSender 
and SimpleReceiver) provide everything a simple application needs. 

However, they do not allow for any customization of the channel and transport, including
the use of security.
