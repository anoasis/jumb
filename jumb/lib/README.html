<H1>JRMS 1.1 Release Notes </H1>
<p>
JRMS is a set of Java libraries for building multicast applications.  
It was developed by 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/research" > Sun Microsystems Laboratories</a>.  

<p>
This release of JRMS has been tested on Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, and 2.7,
and Windows NT 4.0.  It is 100% Pure Java, and is compatible with
any platform that supports Java 2.  

<p>
      If you want to jump right in, add the <b>classes.jar</b> file to your
CLASSPATH and try <a href="#slingerApp">running</a> the SlingerSwing sample 
application. 
<p><BR>

<hr>
<a name="install"> <H2>JRMS Package Installation Procedures </H2> </a>
<p>
This release consists of the following directories and files:

<pre>
  
classes.jar     JRMSUsageGuide.html    README.html
javadoc         LICENSE.TXT            src

</pre>

<p>
The <b>javadoc</b> directory includes all of the java API html files.  
The license terms you agreed to are in <b>LICENSE.TXT</b>.
The <b>src</b> directory contains all of the sources and a top level Makefile.
<p>
The <b>classes.jar</b> file contains all of the Java class files.  Copy
this file to all systems on which you want to run JRMS applications 
and add the classes.jar and its directory path to your CLASSPATH
environment variable.  
<p>

<p>
<H2>Writing Your Own JRMS Application</H2>
<p>
The best way to get started with JRMS is to read the
<a href="JRMSUsageGuide.html"> Quick Guide</a> to Writing JRMS Applications.
More detailed information can be found in the <a href="#docs"> JRMS documents</a>.
<p><BR>

<hr>
<a name="slingerApp"> <H2>Building the JRMS Code</H2></a>
<p>

To build the code, be sure that you have paths to your JDK and JCE in your CLASSPATH.  Also add the jrms1.1/classes directory to the CLASSPATH.  This directory is automatically built when you build JRMS.  Then, from the <b>src</b> directory, type 'make'.
<p><BR>

<hr>
<a name="slingerApp"> <H2>Running the SlingerSwing sample application</H2></a>
<p>

Change directory to jrms1.1/src/reliable/sample_code/slingerSwing.
The SlingerSwing program requires that the <b>images</b> directory be in the
current the directory.

The application is then started with the command:
<pre>
       <b>    % java com.sun.multicast.reliable.applications.slinger.SlingerSwing</b>
</pre>
<p>
Start up a few copies of this application (on one machine or several).
The information to control the application can be entered manually
through the user interface or from a <a href="#ConfigFile"> configuration file listed in <b>slgrconf.ini</b></a>.
<p>
Copy this configuration file to each of the systems running the
application.  Load the file with the "Load All Settings from the Configuration File"
button on the Configuration screen.  The sample configuration file will send the file 
/tmp/test.txt on the multicast address 224.25.25.9 and port 4321.  This information
is advertised to receivers as slingerChannel99 for the slingerApplication.  Set one 
of the applications to be the sender and the others to be receivers. 
<p>
The channel and application names must be the same on both
the sender and the receivers.  Receivers must enter the directory where
files being transferred are to be written.  Receivers must specify a
"Wait time" for listening for the advertisement from the sender for
this application.  300 seconds is a typical value for "Wait Time".
<p>
Once the sender and receivers are configured, click the 
"Receive File(s)" button on the receivers, then the "Send File(s)" button on
the sender.  After the initial handshake and delay, the file specified
at the sender is transferred to all receivers.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="ConfigFile"> <h2>Sample Configuration File. </h2> </a>

The following is a configuration file that can be used to initialize the
SlingerSwing application.  A "#" in the beginning of a line marks the line to be 
treated as a comment line.

<pre>
# slingerProperties.cfg
slinger.address = 224.25.25.9
slinger.application = slingerApplication
slinger.channel = slingerChannel99
slinger.delay = 30
slinger.linger = 30
slinger.port = 4321
slinger.receive = /home/temp
slinger.send = /tmp/test.txt
slinger.speed = 25000
slinger.transport = TRAM
slinger.ttl = 1
slinger.uport = 4322
slinger.verbose = false
slinger.wait = 300

<a name="LRMP"> <H2> Light-weight Reliable Multicast Protocol </h2> </a>
<p>
With the assistance of Tie Liao of Inria, this version of JRMS
includes support for the Light-weight Reliable Multicast Protocol
(LRMP).  This protocol supports multiple senders on a single multicast
address.  For more information about LRMP, see the <a href="http://webcanal.inria.fr">
LRMP web site</a>.  To use LRMP in JRMS, see the javadoc for classes in 
the package <b>com.sun.multicast.reliable.transport.lrmp </b>.
<p>
  This release includes version 1.4.2 of LRMP.

<a name="AuthSpecCreation"> <H2> Authentication Spec Creation Procedure</h2> </a>
<pre>

   Execute the following command to create an AuthenticationSpec: 
 
   Command Syntax:
     <b> java com.sun.multicast.reliable.authentication.AuthenticationSpec < Algorithm > < SenderHostname > 
         < KeyStore provider > < keyStore filename > < keyStore password >
         < senderspec filename > < receiverspec filename > </b>
 
   Example:
    The following will yield 2 AuthenticationSpec files.  One spec (s1.spec) is to be
    used by the sender while the other (r1.spec) is to be used by all of
    the receivers.  The algorithm used in this case is DSA and the sender 
    node is identified as "poplar".  The keyStore file for the private key used
    by the sender(s) is 'authStore'.  It uses the standard Sun Java KeyStore Provider
    (JKS), and the password 'authPassword'.  
 
   <b> java com.sun.multicast.reliable.authentication.AuthenticationSpec DSA poplar JKS authStore authPassword s1.spec r1.spec </b>
